    <h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>
</div>
<div id="Reading1">
    <p>The readings were from<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/github-microsoft-open-source-code-technology">Jacobin Magazine</a>and<a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/the-programmed-designer">Eye Magazine.</a></p>
</div>  
<div id="question1">
    <p>1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? 

       <p>2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice? </p>
</div> 
<div id="answer1">
    <p>1.In the first article Apple and Adobe exert a kind of duopoly over the field of graphic design. As 'industry standard' tools, they are synonymous with both the production and identity of graphic designers. Most designers cannot imagine practising without using their products. The graphic designer's identity has become brand-specific, enmeshed as it is with these products. Both have succeeded in creating scenarios where consumers completely equate specific forms of activity with their brands. Whereas in the second article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of computer coding software, pointing out that many of these programs created by small firms or people are frequently purchased by huge organizations, as seen by Microsoft's purchase of Github. In addition to supplying open-source code, Github, according to the research, manages large projects and serves as a social network. Both of these articles are talking about the disadvantage to the designer and try to produce a solution.
      </p> <p>2.Skills that I would consider as an integral part of my graphic design practice are understanding the fundaments of design. Being able to use the resources around me and think out of the box to produce something new.

    <h2>Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...
    </h2>
</div>
<div id="Reading2">
    <p>The readings were from<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/">Turing Complete User</a>and<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge....</a></p>
</div>
<div id="question2">
    <p>1. What do you think of Lialina's definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example.</p>
<p>2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</p>
</div> 
<div id="answer2">
    <p>1. Lialina depicts universal users as being autonomous and getting things done all by themselves.  In this manner it connects with Shwulst's contention about having your own website that you shape and form into what ever you need it to be as opposed to being reliant upon a bigger stage.
        Schwult contends that it's instrumental that websites progress alongside us assuming a website has vast conceivable outcomes and our thoughts are made by extended by them. She accepts that every individual ought to make their own space on the web, who can ponder what a website can be. She contends that the ability to be widespread is still within each one of us, regardless of the way that there can be various models and levels of independence that clients can envision for themselves.
        </p> 
        <p>2. I’d say I am a real user, as Lialina quoted “those who pay money to use the system” because I’m paying for pretty much everything whether it’s for entertainment or for professional usage. I’d say Internet itself is a sort of luxury and yet a basic necessity these days. There’s a quote from an Indian movie Gully boy, “ The basic toolkit of existence in 21st century is food, clothes, shelter and internet”. As much as love being the part of this “system”, as a designer it constantly makes me question my work’s authenticity.

    <h2>Reading Discussion III: Code, letters, logic, play
    </h2>
 </div>

 <div id="question3">
</div> <p>1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature. </p>

    <p>The readings were from<a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play">The Importance of Play</a>and<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">Math, Logic, Design?</a> </p>
</div>

<div id="answer3">
    <p>For the first discussion prompt, I will use an example of a butterfly wing.</p>

       <p>Many natural patterns emerge from chemical processes that occur while the organism displaying the patterns develops. Butterfly wings are made up of a variety of designs, and each species has its own unique pattern combination. The nymphalid groundplan is thought to be the basis for butterfly wing colour patterns. The butterfly serves as an excellent illustration of natural patterns. These gorgeous critters have a pair of distinct wings that mirror each other in design. Butterflies and moths are two examples of bilaterally symmetrical organisms. They have a single line of symmetry running down the centre of their bodies, which means their wing patterns are identical on both sides. The patterns on one side of a butterfly's wing are substantially different from the ones on the other side. Butterflies employ muted colours and patterns on one wing surface to conceal from predators and flashy colours on the other to attract mates. A great number of colourful scale cells cover the butterfly wings. </p>

    <h2>Reading Discussion IV:  In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl
    </h2>
 </div>
 <div id="Reading4">
    <p>The readings were from<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/">In Free Fall.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="question4">
<p>1. A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.</p>
</div>
<div id="answer3">
<p> I would define 'surveillance' as keeping a close eye on someone or something. Steyerl walks over the history of different perspectives and their evolution in the piece, finally arriving at how technologies like Google Earth are now able to provide aerial map views. We also have drones and satellites flying about in the sky, and there are a variety of reasons for groups to wish to deploy aerial surveillance equipment. Furthermore, technology like drones, which have been popular for a long time, is so simple to acquire and operate that people have just adopted them into their daily lives. It conveys the concept that many of the ideas we encounter may be either beneficial or harmful to numerous individuals and civilizations. Many of the viewpoints we use now just represent one point of view and do not show different points of view. We only get to see half version of events if we don't hear from other individuals.</p>
